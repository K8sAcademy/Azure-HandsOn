### Docker

Learn how to containerize applications with the Docker CLI and Visual Studio Code. Push and pull container images on Docker Hub, a container registry. Learn how to create multi-container applications using Docker Compose.​

### Kubernetes

Learn about the Kubernetes architecture and how it works. Run it locally and use the Kubernetes CLI and Visual Studio Code to run, debug and troubleshoot applications and services. Learn about pods and the different workloads available. Configure networking, storage and set liveness and readiness probes.

### Azure App Service

Deploy and manage single and multiple container applications on App Service. Perfect for smaller workloads that don't require a full blown orchestration service like Kubernetes.

### Azure Container Instances (ACI)

With ACI, run containers the serverless way without managing servers. Provision additional compute for demanding workloads. Use ACI to elastically burst from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when traffic comes in spikes.

### Azure Container Apps

Run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform without the need to manage and maintain a Kubernetes cluster. Container Apps is built on top of Kubernetes and is perfect for workloads that don't require a full blown Kubernetes cluster. You can even scale to zero instances if you want.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Deploy and manage containerized applications with a fully managed Kubernetes service. Learn how to configure persistence using Azure Storage. Scale pods using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Nodes using the Cluster Autoscaler.

### Infrastructure as Code

Learn how to use Infrastructure as Code with over 100 minutes of content on Terraform. Deploy an AKS cluster using Terraform, and learn how to use Terraform Cloud.

### Tools and Service Mesh

Learn how to use Helm to package and deploy applications. Learn about the benefits of using a service mesh by "meshing" and troubleshooting an application using Linkerd.

### Monitoring

Collect, analyze and act on telemetry data gathered from your Kubernetes clusters and containers using Azure Monitor. Learn also how to use Prometheus and Grafana.

## Description

This technical course covers the core Docker and Kubernetes concepts and guides you to build, deploy and monitor containers on Azure and Azure Kubernetes Service. Developers, DevOps, SREs and I.T. Pros will learn how to use containers locally and on Azure. You’ll experience several demos and hands-on exercises throughout the course as you learn how to build, deploy and monitor containers on Azure. No coding experience is required for the hands-on activities but you’ll use the terminal, command prompt and VS Code extensively.

You’ll learn about microservices and their use cases. You’ll then learn about containers and how to deploy them in different Azure services providing you with a solid foundation essential for learning Kubenernetes.

Next, learn all about Kubenernetes and it’s concepts. You’ll learn how to deploy and manage microservices applications packaged in containers locally. This will provide you the essential foundation that you’ll need before heading to the cloud.

Next, it’s all about Kubenernetes on Azure. You’ll apply what you learned previously so that you can deploy, manage and maintain your applications on Azure Kubernetes Service like a ninja!

You’ll learn about 3rd party tools like Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana. How to use dashboards like Lens and K9s. How to configure an Ingress controller and learn the benefits of using a Service Mesh and how to use one.

Finally, you’ll learn about Infrastructure as Code with a complete set of lectures and labs on Terraform. You’ll deploy an AKS cluster using Terraform, and learn how to use Terraform Cloud, the SaaS service from HashiCorp.
