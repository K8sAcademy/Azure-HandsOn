We want to containerize a simple HTML page.  To do that youâ€™ll need to create a Dockerfile.

## Add a Dockerfile file

Add a new file and name it **Dockerfile** (without any file extension).

Copy and paste the following in the file and save it:

    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

## Build the image

    docker build -t hello-world:v1 .

## list the images

    docker images

## Let's create an instance of the image

    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name hello hello-world:v1

## List the containers running

    docker ps

## Display the page using curl

    curl localhost:8080

or use your browser. Navigate to https://localhost:8080

## Stop the container

Refresh the browser to confirm that it has stopped

    docker stop hello

## List the containers running

You should not see the hello-world:v1 instance anymore.

    docker ps

## Remove the instance from memory

    docker rm hello

## Confirm that the container is no longer running

    docker ps

## Is the image still present?

    docker images

## Delete the image

    docker rmi hello-world:v1
